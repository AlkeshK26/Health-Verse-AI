    desc: 'A powerful isolation exercise for the long head of the triceps. Precise elbow tracking is required to avoid joint pain.',
    benefits: [
      'Long Head Growth: The overhead position places the long head under a significant stretch, which is vital for arm size.',
      'Reduced Joint Stress: Proper elbow pathing ensures the load stays on the muscle, not the tendons.'
    ],
    steps: [
      'Sit on a bench with back support. Lift the dumbbell overhead.',
      'MISTAKE: Do not let your elbows flare out excessively.',
      'CORRECTION: Keep your elbows tucked in and tracking forward slightly.',
      'Lower the weight deep behind your head for a full stretch, then extend back to the starting position.'

      'High Volume: Great for high-rep finishing sets to exhaust the muscle.',
      'Accessibility: Can be performed almost anywhere with a stable elevated surface.'
    ],
    steps: [
      'Place your hands on the edge of the bench, shoulder-width apart.',
      'MISTAKE: Keeping your hips too far from the bench or flaring elbows (Red Line).',
      'CORRECTION: Keep your back close to the bench and elbows tucked straight back (Green Line).',
      'Lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle, then push back up.'

    video: tricepPushdownVideo, 
    desc: 'The staple movement for tricep definition. Small adjustments prevent your chest and shoulders from taking over.',
    benefits: [
        'Constant Tension: Cables keep the triceps under load throughout the entire rep.',

    benefits: [
        'Versatile Back Development: Efficiently targets the lats, traps, and rhomboids by simply modifying hand positioning.',
        'Continuous Resistance: Unlike free weights, cables maintain constant tension on the muscle through both the pull and release phases.',
        'Postural Support: Strengthening these muscle groups helps counteract rounded shoulders and supports a healthy spine.'

    steps: [
        'Stand facing the cable machine with a slight bend in your knees and hinge at the hips at a 45-degree angle.',
        'TARGET LOWER LATS: Pull the bar toward your waist or hip area while keeping your elbows tucked close to your body.',
        'TARGET MID-BACK: Pull the bar toward your middle stomach, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the peak of the movement.',
        'TARGET UPPER BACK: Use a wider grip on the bar and pull toward your upper chest with your elbows flared out to the sides.',
        'Maintain a neutral spine and a controlled tempo throughout the entire set to maximize muscle engagement.'

        'Set the cable pulley to upper chest or eye level and attach a rope handle.',
        'Grip the rope with your thumbs facing toward you (neutral grip) and pull toward your forehead.',
        'MISTAKE: Do not pull the rope toward your chin or neck, as this shifts tension away from the rear delts.',
        'CORRECTION: Pull the rope directly toward your forehead while flaring your elbows high and wide.',
